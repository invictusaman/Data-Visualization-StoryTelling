# Data StoryTelling 

This repository is to demonstrate my data story telling skills in describing data visualization concepts - **Waffle Chart, Word Cloud, Seaborn and Regression Plot**. This was conducted as a part of NPower Training Program.

You can find the story in both markdown and pdf format, and presentation too.   

At the end of each section, we had created _couple of questions_ to revise the concepts, and later a game named "**Who wants to be a Data Analyst?**" was played live during the session. It resemble similar questions and answers format inspired by the popular show "Who wants to be a Millionaire?". We had two sets of 10 questions each, for two fastest finger winners.

You can also play the game live at,
